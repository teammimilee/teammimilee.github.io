      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good day, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I informed my friends and supporters that I would be the federal election candidate for the People’s Party of Canada (PPC), their reactions ranged from surprise to curiosity. My journey as a candidate for public office has been anything but conventional, and I’d like to share my story with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may know that I was once the Markham-Thornhill candidate for the Green Party of Canada (GPC). While my reasons for leaving the GPC are not the focus here, this is about my fresh start with the PPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, when COVID-19 descended on our country, I was deeply skeptical of the vaccine mandate. Eventually, I reluctantly received the first two standard vaccinations, as traveling was an absolute necessity for me. During my travels within Canada and abroad, I engaged in countless discussions about vaccinations—their consequences, the legality of mandates, and the medical evidence surrounding them. These conversations were as diverse as they were compelling, with strong opinions from colleagues and interest groups in Canada and Hong Kong. Each perspective deserved consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what prompted my shift to the PPC? Maxime Bernier stood out as the one party leader who unequivocally supported non-vaccinated citizens. Initially, my knowledge of the PPC was limited, but after researching their platform and having compelling discussions with committed and informed individuals, I decided to apply for candidacy. A phone call from Maxime Bernier himself sealed the deal. After a wonderful conversation, I chose to represent the PPC in the next federal election.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome back! In my previous section, I shared my journey from the Green Party of Canada (GPC) to the People’s Party of Canada (PPC). Now, let’s explore why I chose the PPC and my stance on key issues.
&lt;h2&gt;Why PPC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PPC is the only party that consistently upholds Canadian values. As immigrants, many of us have chosen Canada as our home because of its uniqueness. We strive to integrate, contribute, and protect Canadian values while honoring our respective heritages. Back in summer 2019, I voiced on CBC’s Metro Morning that our country needs reform, and I stand by that belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada faces numerous challenges: neglected infrastructure, an outdated educational system, a housing crisis, an overwhelmed healthcare system, unsafe streets, and the consequences of nine years of governmental neglect. We must regroup, take stock, and rebuild. While welcoming immigrants is vital, we must drastically reduce that number and ensure Canada’s socio-economic and infrastructure systems before we can support more. Immigration policies should reflect not just numbers but compatibility with Canadian values, including respect for our flag, culture, and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other key Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crime rate: The Canadian justice system is too lenient with repeated criminals, which should be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;
Internal Trade: It’s absurd that traveling within Canada is often more expensive than traveling abroad. Restrictions like limited alcohol transportation across provinces highlight a broken system. Mobility for skilled workers is restricted, stifling economic growth. Canadians deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing: Money laundering has distorted the housing market, making real estate unaffordable for genuine residents. We need better infrastructure, including bike lanes, to support overcrowded communities and encourage people to move to the outskirts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: Canada’s healthcare system has been inadequate for decades. A two-tier system, like the UK’s, could provide people with the choice to avoid long waits in the public system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Policy: The UN has become dysfunctional, often siding with China and Russia. Canada should withdraw and develop political leverage and economic independence to protect human rights and natural resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply Management: Local food is often more expensive than imported food due to flawed supply management. This system needs reform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment: Global warming is real, but it’s often exploited for hidden agendas. Practical solutions, like clean drinking water for remote First Nations communities, are essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy and Governance: The pandemic exposed Liberal-NDP mismanagement, worsening our economy. We need MPs who genuinely represent Canadians’ viewpoints, not party interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know, the big parties enforce a party whip, which means their MPs often prioritize the party’s stance over the voices of their constituents. If your MP isn’t listening to you, why are you voting for them? Smaller parties, on the other hand, are more likely to listen to voters because they’re working hard to earn your trust and your vote. Supporting these parties can lead to a more representative and responsive Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-you-thought-lockdown-was-bad-just-wait-until-the-next-federal-election&quot;&gt;The late Max Murphy, one of the most influential commentators in Canada, wrote&lt;/a&gt; before the last election: “Candidates: This is the only area in which some small hope may be entertained. With well over 300 seats up for contest in the House of Commons, there will be at least three or four, in a good year even nine or 10, candidates who will prove upon election to be outstanding MPs, and even more, just outstanding citizens and people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a board member of Fair Vote Canada for nearly 3 years (currently taking a Leave of Absence from the Fair Vote Canada Board while running my campaign), I believe it’s crucial to have more people represented in the House. Electoral reform allows us to push for a system that better reflects the will of the people and ensures every vote truly counts.&lt;br /&gt;
Please don’t hesitate to vote for candidates who have a passion to work for you (not for their parties) even though they might have certain stands that are different from you. You will never have complete consensus and no one will agree with any platform 100%, that’s life and that’s democracy. Agree to disagree and respect others’ opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. I hope this provides clarity on my stance and inspires you to engage in shaping Canada’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
